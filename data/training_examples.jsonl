These and other features and advantages of some implementations will be presented in more detail in the following specification and the accompanying figures which illustrate by way of example some of the disclosed principles. \n Patent 2: API and Business Language Schema Design Framework for Message Exchanges:\n In one example, a server system facilitates an exchange of messages with a remote client application. An Application Program Interface (API) receives a first request message and a second request message, wherein the first request message includes a first data payload defined by a common definition and including a first payload data, the first payload defined by a first schema definition. The second request message includes a second data payload defined by the common definition and a second payload data, wherein the second payload is defined by a second schema definition different than the first schema definition. In response to receiving the first request message, the API transmits a first response message, and in response to receiving the second request message, the API transmits a second response. \n SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION: According one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a server system to facilitate an exchange of messages with a remote client application. The server system includes a plurality of application servers hosting a plurality of applications. A plurality of Application Program Interfaces (APIs) provides programmatic access to the plurality of applications, each of the APIs being configured to receive request messages compiled by the remote client application. First and second request messages, respectively addressed to first and second APIs of the plurality of APIs, each comprise at least one common data component. Further, the first request message includes a first payload specific to the first API, and the second request message includes a payload specific to the second API. \n Patent 1 is considered the prior art. With that in mind, provide an assessment of the novelty of Patent 2 compared to Patent 1. Then state whether Patent 2 demonstrates enough novelty to be granted a patent based on your analysis using Patent 1 as the benchmark."},{"role":"assistant","name":"example_assistant","content":"Key Similarities:\n 1. Both patents involve managing message exchanges within a computer network. \n 2. Each patent involves the use of an Application Program Interface (API) for facilitating message exchanges. \n 3. Both patents describe the reception of request messages and the transmission of response messages. \n 4. They both pertain to the exchange of messages between different applications or services within a computer network. \n 5. Both patents involve the use of correlation information or session information for managing the messages or interactions.\nKey Differences: \n 1. Patent 1 focuses on a message interchange network that facilitates the exchange of application-level messages between services. It involves retaining correlation information for each application-level message. \n 2.Patent 2 is centered around a server system that facilitates an exchange of messages with a remote client application. It involves multiple APIs for different applications, each handling specific payloads. \n 3. Patent 1 emphasizes the forwarding of received application-level messages towards receiving services, whereas Patent 2 doesn't explicitly mention this process. \n 4. Patent 1 includes specific aspects related to the completion of message transmission and the registration of services, while Patent 2 does not explicitly discuss these aspects. \n 5. Patent 2 mentions the use of a plurality of application servers hosting various applications, a detail not explicitly highlighted in Patent 1.\n Assessment:Based on the comparison between Patent 1 and Patent 2, it is evident that Patent 2 introduces several distinctive elements not found in Patent 1, particularly the emphasis on multiple APIs for different applications and the interaction with a remote client application. Given the significant differences outlined, Patent 2 demonstrates enough novelty to be granted a patent, as it introduces a unique approach that differs from the existing methods described in Patent 1."}]}

The textiles are then subjected to a specific temperature for a certain period. This process results in the textiles achieving the desired level of whiteness. The textiles are then rinsed and dried. \n\n Prior Art Claims: The invention claims the method of bleaching textiles using a bleaching agent, a specific temperature, and time. \n\n New Patent Title: 'Improved Method for Bleaching Textiles' \n\n New Patent Abstract: The invention pertains to an improved method for bleaching textiles. It involves the use of a bleaching agent and a specific temperature and time to achieve a high level of whiteness. \n\n New Patent Summary: The improved method involves immersing the textiles in a solution that contains a bleaching agent. The textiles are then subjected to a specific temperature for a certain period. This process allows the textiles to achieve a high level of whiteness.

Both methods involve the use of a bleaching agent, a specific temperature, and time to bleach textiles. \n\n 2. Both methods result in textiles achieving a certain level of whiteness. \n\n Key Similarities: \n\n 1. The process steps, including the use of a bleaching agent, a specific temperature, and time, are identical in both methods. \n\n 2. The end result, a certain level of whiteness in the textiles, is common to both methods. \n\n Differences and Unique Features: \n\n 1. The new patent application does not specify any unique features or improvements over the prior art. \n\n Based on these observations, it appears that the new patent application does not introduce any novel elements that significantly differentiate it from the prior art. The new patent application seems to mimic the process described in the prior art without any substantial improvements or unique features. Therefore, under 35 U.S.C. § 103, the new patent application should be rejected for not being a non-obvious improvement over the prior art."}]}
