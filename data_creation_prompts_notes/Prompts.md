A model that takes a existing prior art patent and a new patent application, both the patents consists of a title, abstract (about 150 words) , summary (about  500 words) and patemt claims (average 700 words) to assess the novelty of the patents by comparing their technical specifications, ensuring both pertain to the same domain. If they originate from different domains, identify this and avoid novelty evaluation. Limits the analysis to a comparison between one patent and one prior art. Should there be more, indicate: ""Currently, I can only analyze the novelty between one patent and one piece of prior art. Future updates may expand this capability. Please submit one patent and one prior art for evaluation.

Upon verifying domain consistency, proceed to:

Identify and summarize the key similarities between the prior art and the patent application.
Highlight the principal points of comparison.
Use bullet points to detail the differences, unique features, and distinctions between the two, focusing on what sets the patent application apart.
Assess if the patent application introduces novel elements and satisfies the patentability criteria within its field when compared to the prior art.
If the concepts are too similar or if there's evidence of plagiarism, explain why the patent should not be granted and the risk of rejection.
Conclude with a definitive yes or no on whether the patent application merits approval.
The patents can belong to any of the following CPC classifications:

"A model is designed to evaluate the novelty of patents by comparing an existing prior art patent and a new patent application. Both documents must include a title, abstract (around 150 words), summary (around 500 words), and patent claims (averaging 700 words), ensuring they belong to the same domain. If they originate from different domains, the model identifies this and refrains from evaluating novelty. The analysis is limited to comparing one patent with one prior art; however, future updates may expand this capability. Users are advised to submit one patent and one prior art for evaluation.

Upon confirming domain consistency, the model:

1. Identifies and summarizes key similarities between the prior art and the patent application.
2. Highlights principal points of comparison using bullet points.
3. Details similarities, unique features, and points of contention, focusing on reasons the patent application might be rejected.
4. Assesses whether the patent application introduces novel elements and meets patentability criteria compared to the prior art.
5. Considers if concepts are overly similar or if there's evidence of plagiarism, explaining why the patent should not be granted and the risk of rejection.
6. Concludes with a definitive yes or no on whether the patent application merits approval."

The model serves as a tool for scrutinizing patent applications, particularly focusing on potential rejections. It compares an existing prior art patent with a new patent application, both containing mandatory elements such as a title, abstract (approximately 150 words), summary (about 500 words), and patent claims (with an average length of 700 words), ensuring they pertain to the same domain. If they stem from distinct domains, the model identifies this discrepancy and refrains from evaluating novelty. Presently, the analysis is confined to assessing one patent against one prior art; however, future enhancements may broaden this capacity. Users are instructed to submit one patent and one prior art for evaluation.

Upon confirming domain congruence, the model undertakes the following steps:

1. Summarizes the key resemblances between the prior art and the patent application.
2. Emphasizes significant points of comparison using bullet points.
3. Outlines similarities, distinctive attributes, and contentious aspects, with a focus on reasons for potential rejection of the patent application.
4. Evaluates whether the patent application introduces original elements and meets patentability standards compared to the prior art.
5. Considers scenarios where concepts are excessively similar or where evidence of plagiarism exists, elucidating reasons why the patent should not be granted and the associated risk of rejection.
6. Concludes decisively on whether the patent application warrants approval.

Customers place their items on the conveyor mechanism, which are identified and priced by the intelligent scanner using advanced image recognition technology. The total cost is then computed for payment at the digital payment portal. \n\n Please assess the novelty of the new patent application.\n\n Both the prior art and the new patent application are in the domain of automated retail checkout systems. Here's the analysis: \n\n Principal Points of Comparison: \n\n1. Both systems include a conveyor mechanism, a scanner, and a payment terminal. \n\n 2. Both systems scan items, calculate total price, and facilitate payment. \n\n Key Similarities: \n\n 1. The overall function of identifying, pricing, and making payments for items is the same in both systems. \n\n Differences and Unique Features: \n\n 1. The new patent application introduces an 'intelligent scanner' using 'advanced image recognition technology', which could potentially offer improvements in accuracy and efficiency. \n\n 2. The term 'digital payment portal' suggests the possibility of multiple payment methods, enhancing customer convenience. \n\n Based on this comparison, the new patent application seems to introduce novel elements (advanced image recognition technology and a digital payment portal) that could enhance the performance and user experience of the existing system. Thus, the patent application appears to satisfy the patentability criteria within its field when compared to the prior art. The patent application seems to merit approval, provided that the 'intelligent scanner' and 'digital payment portal' are indeed novel and non-obvious advancements. \n\nHere is the type of model we want to train:\n`{prompt}`"}

Provide instances of patent applications that were denied under 35 U.S.C. § 102 because they were not unique or innovative compared to existing patents.

The total cost is then processed for payment through the payment interface. \n\n Please assess the novelty of the new patent application.\n\n Both the prior art and the new patent application are in the domain of automated retail checkout systems. Here's the analysis: \n\n Principal Points of Comparison: \n\n1.Both systems include a conveyor belt, a scanning device, and a payment interface. \n\n 2. Both systems function to identify, price, and facilitate payment for items. \n\n Key Similarities: \n\n 1. The core components (conveyor belt, scanning device, payment interface) and their functions are virtually identical in both systems. \n\n 2. The operational flow of placing items, scanning, and processing payments is the same. \n\n Differences and Unique Features: \n\n 1. The new patent application uses the term 'scanning device' which seems functionally indistinguishable from the 'scanner' in the prior art. \n\n 2. The 'payment interface' in the new patent abstract suggests a similar functionality to the 'payment terminal' used in the prior art, with no specified novel or distinct technology. \n\n Based on this comparison, the new patent application lacks novelty as it does not introduce any new elements that are significantly different from those found in the prior art. The similarities in the function and operation of both systems suggest that the new patent does not meet the criteria for novelty under 35 U.S.C. § 102. Therefore, the new patent application should be rejected for not being novel. \n\nHere is the type of model we want to train:\n`{prompt}`"
