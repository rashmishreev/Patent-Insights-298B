      "content": "Given an existing prior art patent and a new patent application, both consisting of a title, abstract, summary, and patent claims, assess the novelty of the new patent by comparing their technical specifications. Ensure they pertain to the same domain. If they don't, indicate this and avoid novelty evaluation. Identify key similarities, highlight principal points of comparison, detail the differences, and assess if the new patent introduces novel elements. If too similar, explain why the patent should not be granted. Conclude with a definitive answer on whether the patent application merits approval."

      "content": "Prior Art Patent: Multi-protocol charge port for an electric vehicle\nAbstract: A method of charging an electric vehicle at a charging station includes electrically connecting the charging station to the vehicle. The charging station may be configured to charge the vehicle using a charging station charge protocol and the vehicle may be configured to receive the charge using a vehicle charge protocol. The vehicle receives a signal indicative of the charging station charge protocol and selects the vehicle charge protocol based on this signal. The vehicle is then charged using the selected vehicle charge protocol. While selecting, the vehicle may select one charge protocol from multiple charge protocols supported by the vehicle to match the charging station charge protocol.\n\nClaims: \n1. A method of conductive charging an electric vehicle at a charging station, the charging station being configured to provide charge to the vehicle using a charging station charge protocol and the vehicle being configured to receive charge from the charging station using a vehicle charge protocol, comprising:\nconnecting an electrical connector of the charging station to a charge port of the vehicle, the electrical connector including multiple electrodes that mate with electrodes of the charge port to form multiple contacts that electrically connect the charging station to the vehicle;\nreceiving, at the vehicle, through a first contact of the multiple contacts, a signal indicative of the charging station charge protocol;\nautomatically selecting the vehicle charge protocol to be a first charge protocol if the signal received through the first contact is a first value and selecting the vehicle charge protocol to be a second charge protocol if the signal received through the first contact is a second value different from the first value, wherein the first charge protocol and the second charge protocol are different charge protocols that define conductive charging of the vehicle by providing DC current to the charge port from the charging station; and\ncharging the vehicle using the selected vehicle charge protocol.\n2. The method of claim 1, wherein automatically selecting the vehicle charge protocol includes selecting SAE J1772 as the charge protocol if the signal is a voltage of about 1.5 V and selecting a different charge protocol if the signal is a voltage of about 2.08 V.\n3. The method of claim 1, wherein connecting an electrical connector of the charging station includes connecting a SAE J1772 connector of the charging station to a SAE J1772 charge port of the vehicle.\n4. The method of claim 3, wherein:\nreceiving the signal includes receiving a voltage on a proximity detection pin of the SAE J1772 charge port; and\nautomatically selecting the vehicle charge protocol includes selecting (a) SAE J1772 as the charge protocol if the received voltage is about 1.51 V DC, and (b) a different charge protocol if the received voltage is about 2.08 V DC.\n5. The method of claim 4, wherein automatically selecting the vehicle charge protocol includes directing a signal from the vehicle to a control pilot pin of the SAE J1772 connector if the different charge protocol is selected.\n\nNew Patent: In vitro evolution in microfluidic systems\nAbstract: The invention describes a method for isolating one or more genetic elements encoding a gene product having a desired activity, comprising the steps of: (a) compartmentalising genetic elements into microcapsules; and (b) sorting the genetic elements which express the gene product having the desired activity; wherein at least one step is under microfluidic control. The invention enables the in vitro evolution of nucleic acids and proteins by repeated mutagenesis and iterative applications of the method of the invention.\n\nClaims:\nWhat is claimed is:\n1. A method for analyzing compounds, the method comprising:\nproviding a droplet generator comprising a nozzle through which aqueous fluid is flowed under microfluidic control into a reservoir of oil to form a plurality of aqueous microcapsules in the oil, wherein each aqueous microcapsule comprises a genetic element and a cell;\nincubating the plurality of aqueous microcapsules to cause the genetic element to interact with a molecule associated with the cell;\nconducting an enzymatic reaction involving the molecule associated with the cell within one or more of the aqueous microcapsules, wherein the genetic element or a gene product encoded by the genetic element has an effect on the enzymatic reaction, to produce reaction products corresponding to individual gene products or genetic elements; and\nanalyzing the individual genetic elements identified based on detection of a selectable change caused by the reaction products in one or more of the aqueous microcapsules.\n2. The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of aqueous microcapsules are unable to fuse or coalesce due to the presence of a surfactant.\n3. The method of claim 1, wherein the selectable change comprises an optical signal.\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein the genetic element comprises one or more primer sequences for amplification.\n5. The method of claim 1, wherein the genetic element is attached to a bead."

The first patent is related to charging protocol for electric vehicles, while the second patent application is related to in vitro evolution in microfluidic systems. Therefore, the evaluation of novelty between the first patent and the second patent application is not applicable. The two documents do not share similarities in domain or technical specifications. The evaluation of novelty will require comparing the key features and elements of the specific domain in which both documents are classified.
