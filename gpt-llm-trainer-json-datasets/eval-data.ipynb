Ensure they pertain to the same domain. If they don't, indicate this and avoid novelty evaluation. Identify key similarities, highlight principal points of comparison, detail the differences, and assess if the new patent introduces novel elements. If too similar, explain why the patent should not be granted. Conclude with a definitive answer on whether the patent application merits approval.\"\n",
